# NSF LaTeX Template
The [very initial version of this template] (http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~sgille/how_to/proposal_prep.html) was created by Sarah Gille. This current version of the template follows the guidelines in [NSF GPG 15-1](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg15001&org=NSF).

It is your responsibility to make sure that everything
is in agreement with the current NSF GPG and your program solicitation. Good luck!
